# Purpose
This repository is the place where ideas are combined together, 
translated and then compiled into the docs with high level description of the basic project's vision.  

# Content
Th repo contains 2 types of docs:

1. `*.md` files — sources — raw version of the content in a format which is super easy to edit and to maintain.
2. `*.pdf` files — compiled releases of the docs provided. Check [releases section](https://github.com/vTCP-Foundation/paper/releases) for the last version.

# How to edit
You can chose your favorite way to edit `*.md` files. 
We are using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) to edit and to compile the content into the final PDF versions.
When ready — just fill the merge request and keep in touch ;)
